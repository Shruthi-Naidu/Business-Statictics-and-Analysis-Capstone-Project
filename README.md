The Business Statistics and Analysis Capstone applies various skills developed across the four courses in the specialization to a real life data. The Capstone, in collaboration with an industry partner uses publicly available ‘Housing Data’ to pose various questions typically a client would pose to a data analyst.
Relevant statistical analysis is performed and findings are reported in response to the questions in a way that anyone can understand.
